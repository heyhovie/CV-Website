Roll dice
Get a question or requirement
- If you meet requirement, proceed
    - Sometimes when you meet requirements you have option to purchase an asset at a discounted price
    - Assets grow your net worth and it affects your ability to bribe, be let off offences, popularity
- If you donâ€™t, get penalised or bribe
    - Depending on your popularity, the bribe could either work or fail
    - Your popularity grows by doing other random tasks like:
        - donating money when you land on less fortunate squares
        - Funding city projects by selling assets
        - Missing a turn to volunteer for community service

    - You can commit an offence if you pass a square with slow regulations at a speed higher than or equal to a 5 on the dice
    - If you pass a square with fast moving regulations at a speed slower than or equal to a 2 on the dice

Goal is to reach the end of the line and retire in good health and good wealth
