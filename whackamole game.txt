Make a game with 4 slots
A mole pops out of each slot and lasts for 2 seconds
Each time the user clicks on the slot with the mole the game launches another mole but the time will have reduced by 1 millisecond, user gets a points equal to the number of milliseconds left. The points are added to a score board). The score board will show the highest recorded score
If the user runs out of time(if the mole retracts before being clicked), game over
If the user clicks the wrong slot (slot without a mole), game over
When the game is over, the score is added to a scores Array with only 2 slots for the previous score and the current score. The higher score is chosen and displayed on the “high score” spot.
The user can refresh the game without refreshing the page. This will make sure the scores are not reset
